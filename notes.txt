add figure for nerve theorem circle cover example

Witness complex adds tie (remove probably)

Every slide have a figure with it

Rule: EVERY SLIDE SHOULD HAVE A PICTURE

references: Mapper Algorithm, Rips, Cech, to everything when I can

add vector notation

U M_i^d_i

could say x_i = m_j + noise vector random :)

citation figure

Generally do construction before definition
