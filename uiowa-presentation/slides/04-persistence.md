## Research Questions

<div class="research-questions">
    <div class="question">
        <h4>RQ1:</h4>
        <p>How does [specific phenomenon] affect [outcome variable] in [context]?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h4>RQ2:</h4>
        <p>What are the underlying mechanisms that explain [relationship] between [variables]?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <h4>RQ3:</h4>
        <p>To what extent do [moderating factors] influence the relationship between [key variables]?</p>
    </div>
</div>

Note: These three research questions form the core of my dissertation. The first question establishes the basic relationship, the second digs into the mechanisms, and the third explores boundary conditions.
