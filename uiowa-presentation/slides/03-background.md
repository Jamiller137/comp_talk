## Topological Data Analysis

The use of tools from topology to extract and study data 'shape' across scales.


## Three Themes

1. Data -> Topological Spaces

2. Persistence and Stability

3. Visualization Methods



## Constructing Topological Spaces

Data typically lacks inherent topological structure 
- there are many approaches for constructing a simplicial
complex from point-cloud data.
