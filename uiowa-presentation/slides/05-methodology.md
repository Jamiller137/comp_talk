## Methodology

Overview of research approach and design


## Research Design

### Mixed Methods Approach

- **Phase 1**: Quantitative survey study (n=500)
- **Phase 2**: Qualitative interviews (n=30)
- **Phase 3**: Experimental validation (n=200)

### Integration Strategy
Sequential explanatory design


## Data Collection

### Quantitative Phase
- Online survey instrument
- Validated scales from literature
- Demographic and control variables
- Power analysis: 80% power, α=0.05

### Qualitative Phase
- Semi-structured interviews
- Purposive sampling
- Interview duration: 45-60 minutes
- Theoretical saturation approach


## Analysis Plan

### Quantitative Analysis
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Multiple regression
- Structural equation modeling

### Qualitative Analysis
- Thematic analysis
- Inductive coding approach
- Inter-rater reliability (κ > 0.80)
- Member checking validation

Note: The mixed methods approach allows me to both test hypotheses quantitatively and explore mechanisms qualitatively. The sequential design means qualitative findings will help explain quantitative results.
